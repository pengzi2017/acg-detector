# ACG-Detector

## ![intro](./icons/001-open-book.png) Introduction

This browser extension helps get to video page based on the specific video ID.

Since every video from [bilibili](http://bilibili.com), [acfun](http://acfun.cn), [niconico](http://www.nicovideo.jp/) and [pixiv.net](pixiv.net)(illustration instead) has a unique ID. It will be convenient to find video by its ID. Instead of copy ID and search in Google, [acg-detector](https://github.com/dyweb/acg-detector) let you open the video link directly.
